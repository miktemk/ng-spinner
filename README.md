ng-spinner
==========

This is a simple, yet powerful AngularJS directive for the jQueryUI spinner widget
It requires jquery.numeric.js but that only makes it better.

Usage:

    <input ng-spinner="someVar" ngMin="2" ngMax="someMaxVar" />
    
As you can see it is pretty diverse, takes all kinds of inputs and never EVER crashes! cheers.
