ng-spinner
==========

This is a simple, yet powerful AngularJS directive for the jQueryUI spinner widget
It requires jquery.numeric.js but that only makes it better.

Usage:

    <input ng-spinner="someVar" ng-min="2" ng-max="someMaxVar" ng-step="myStepVar" />
    
As you can see it is pretty diverse, takes all kinds of inputs and never EVER crashes! cheers.
Compatible with angular 1.4.2 ...I hope!
